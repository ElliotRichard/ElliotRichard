# [Kia ora](https://www.newzealand.com/int/feature/the-meaning-of-kia-ora/)! :new_zealand:
I'm Elliot and I build software :computer:  This is where I keep some of it :orange_book:

I'm currently focused on modern web development with an interest in the javascript ecosystem, particulary Angular & Typescript.
I'm also an aspiring data scientist :thinking: with an interest in Machine Learning :chart_with_upwards_trend:, particulary Natural Language Processing :speak_no_evil:

When I'm not programming I like to unwind with a good film :vhs: (I use the New Zealand based website [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com), and you should too!), or read a nice book :book: (currently making my way through Ubik by Philip K. Dick & The Trial by Franz Kafka). I also enjoy swimming :ocean: and cooking meals :pizza: for those I love, which includes my partner Lara & our cat, Billi, who you can see on the left! :smirk_cat: :paw_prints:
